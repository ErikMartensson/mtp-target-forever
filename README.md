> A free multiplayer online action game where you roll down a giant ramp and delicately land on platforms to score points. Fight with and against players in this mix of action, dexterity, and strategy - inspired by Monkey Target from Super Monkey Ball.

**Status:** 🎮 Playable - Version 1.2.2a client and server with 60 levels (32 fully tested + 28 ported from v1.5.19, in testing)

## About This Project

**MTP Target** was created by Melting Pot in 2003-2004 and went offline around 2013. This is a community effort to bring it back to life by:

1. ✅ **Building a local server** - Run your own game server
2. ✅ **Creating a modern login service** - TypeScript/Deno replacement for authentication
3. ✅ **Compiling the client** - Build from source for debugging and modifications
4. ✅ **Windows support** - Full Windows build with Visual Studio 2022

### Version Strategy

We're currently running **version 1.2.2a** (from this repository's source code) for both client and server. This ensures full compatibility between all components.

**Future Plans:**
- Port features and improvements from version 1.5.19 where possible
- Add additional levels from 1.5.19 release
- Consider protocol upgrade to 1.5.19 if compatible with gameplay

The original v1.5.19 server source is unavailable, so we're starting with the v1.2.2a codebase we have and will enhance it over time.

### Reference Source Code

The v1.5.19 client source code is preserved in [`reference/mtp-target-v1.5.19/`](reference/mtp-target-v1.5.19/) for comparison and asset extraction. This includes shapes and textures for space/sun/city themes that are missing from v1.2.2a.

## Current Status

### What Works ✅

- ✅ **Build System:** Full Windows build with Visual Studio 2022 and automated scripts
- ✅ **Game Server:** Compiles and runs on Windows, 60 levels loaded (32 verified, 28 in per-level testing)
- ✅ **Game Client:** Compiles and runs on Windows with OpenGL/OpenAL drivers
- ✅ **Login Service:** Modern TypeScript/Deno implementation handles authentication
- ✅ **Database:** SQLite-based user and shard management
- ✅ **Physics:** ODE 0.16.5 engine with Lua 5.x scripting
- ✅ **Network:** Full protocol working (VLP login + game server connection)
- ✅ **Controls:** Arrow keys for steering, Ctrl for ball/glide toggle, Enter for chat
- ✅ **Scoring:** Full scoring system with targets and friction
- ⚠️ **Bots:** AI bots present but not working correctly on all maps
- ✅ **Game Assets:** All textures, shapes, sounds included in repository

### Known Issues ⚠️

See [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the complete issue tracker.

See [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the up-to-date list of open and fixed issues. Highlights:

- ⚠️ **Intermittent scoring failure** investigation (high priority, fix applied — needs verification)
- ⚠️ **28 ported v1.5.19 levels** — engine-level fixes applied, per-level testing in progress
- ⚠️ **High ping / input delay on localhost** — not yet investigated
- ⚠️ **Water rendering disabled** — falls back gracefully when textures missing

**The game is fully playable.** All 32 original levels work with proper scoring and physics.

See [docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md](docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md) for detailed fix documentation.

## Quick Start (Windows)

**Prerequisites:**
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (with C++ Desktop Development)
- CMake 3.20+
- 7-Zip (for extracting dependencies)
- PowerShell 5.1+

**Optional:**
- vcpkg (for server builds - ODE physics library)
- Deno 2.6.0+ (for login service, only needed for "Play Online")

### 1. Setup Dependencies

```powershell
# Download and install dependencies (~1.3GB)
.\scripts\setup-deps.ps1

# Client only (skip ODE physics library)
.\scripts\setup-deps.ps1 -SkipODE
```

This downloads pre-built libraries to `deps/` (git-ignored).

### 2. Build RyzomCore (NeL)

One-time build of the NeL engine libraries (~15 minutes):

```powershell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ryzom/ryzomcore.git C:\ryzomcore
cd C:\ryzomcore && mkdir build && cd build

cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 `
    -DWITH_SOUND=ON -DWITH_NEL=ON -DWITH_NEL_TOOLS=OFF `
    -DWITH_NEL_TESTS=OFF -DWITH_NEL_SAMPLES=OFF -DWITH_RYZOM=OFF `
    -DWITH_STATIC=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/path/to/mtp-target-forever/deps"

cmake --build . --config Release --parallel 4 --target nelmisc nel3d nelnet nelsound nelsnd_lowlevel nelgeorges nelligo
cmake --build . --config Release --parallel 2 --target nel_drv_opengl_win nel_drv_openal_win
```

### 3. Build Game

```powershell
.\scripts\build-client.bat
.\scripts\build-server.bat
```

### 4. Run the Game

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start server
.\scripts\run-server.bat

# Terminal 2: Start client (LAN mode - no login service needed)
.\scripts\run-client.bat --lan localhost --user YourName
```

**Controls:**
- **Arrow keys:** Steer penguin (requires speed in ball mode)
- **CTRL:** Toggle between ball/gliding modes
- **Enter:** Open chat (press again to send)
- **Escape:** Cancel chat

**Chat Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/v <name>` | Vote for a level (e.g., `/v arena`) |
| `/forcemap <name>` | Force next level (admin) |
| `/forceend` | End current session (admin) |

See **[docs/LEVELS.md](docs/LEVELS.md)** for the complete level list and map names.

For detailed build instructions and troubleshooting, see **[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)** and **[docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md](docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md)**.

## What We've Fixed

The original code was from 2003-2004 and needed updates for modern systems:

- ✅ **Lua 5.0 → 5.1** - Migrated to currently supported Lua version
- ✅ **64-bit compatibility** - Fixed pointer casts and size types
- ✅ **Modern NeL API** - Updated for RyzomCore (NeL's successor)
- ✅ **ODE 0.5 → 0.16** - Physics engine upgrade
- ✅ **Namespace fixes** - Resolved conflicts with modern C++ std library

See [docs/MODIFICATIONS.md](docs/MODIFICATIONS.md) for technical details.
